# Lessons Learned

* For AprilTagLocalization on the vision consumer you have to use Utils.fpgaToCurrentTime on the timestamp otherwise it wont work
* When creating new limelight details include the inverse of the offset applied to the config
* Make motors have PIDs configured
* When make sure motors have Communication.MotorArrangnet set config
* When applying a control request to a motor make sure its configured with a PID slot
